            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>A healthy diet starts early in life - breastfeeding fosters healthy growth, and may have longer-term
                health benefits, like reducing the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing noncommunicable
                diseases later in life.
                Feeding babies exclusively with breast milk from birth to 6 months of life is important for a healthy
                diet. It is also important to introduce a variety of safe and nutritious complementary foods at 6 months
                of age, while continuing to breastfeed until your child is two years old and beyond.</p>
